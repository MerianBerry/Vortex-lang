# Vortex *a something language*

## *What is it?*

IDK great question.

## *When will it be done?*

When im in the grave.

## *Will it ever be completed?*

In your dreams probably.

## Road map

NOTE: There is NO plans for classes, polymorphism, inheritance and the OPP stuff.

Uh, there wont be a road map for a while.

But currently, the parser is being created before the compiler and runner.

If it will be a compiled, or JIT language, is still being determined.
